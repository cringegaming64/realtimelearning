# Direct Neural Adaptation in Grid Environments: A Novel Approach to Immediate Reward-Based Weight Modification

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel neural network architecture that implements direct weight modification based on immediate rewards in a grid-based environment. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning approaches that rely on backpropagation and temporal difference learning, our system employs instant weight adaptation triggered by environmental feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a navigation task where an agent must reach a goal while avoiding hostile entities. Our results show that this method leads to rapid learning of effective behaviors and develops robust situational responses without the need for extensive training or complex optimization algorithms.

## 1. Introduction
Traditional approaches to reinforcement learning in neural networks typically rely on gradient-based optimization methods and temporal difference learning. While effective, these methods often require extensive training data and multiple passes through the network to learn appropriate behaviors. We propose an alternative approach inspired by immediate biological responses to stimuli, where neural pathways are directly strengthened or weakened based on immediate outcomes.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Traditional Reinforcement Learning
Standard approaches to reinforcement learning in neural networks typically employ:
- Q-learning and its variants
- Policy gradient methods
- Actor-critic architectures

These methods generally rely on the calculation of expected future rewards and backpropagation through time.

### 2.2 Biological Learning
Research in neuroscience suggests that immediate reinforcement of neural pathways plays a crucial role in learning:
- Hebbian learning principles
- Immediate synaptic strengthening in response to stimuli
- Direct modification of neural connections based on outcomes

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Environment Design
Our experimental environment consists of a 20×20 grid world containing:
- An agent seeking to reach a goal
- Multiple hostile entities
- Clear objectives (reaching goal) and dangers (hostile entities)

### 3.2 State Representation
We implement a novel sensor-based state representation consisting of 8 dimensions:
1. Four quadrant-based distance sensors for detecting nearest threats
2. One normalized distance measure to goal
3. Three directional components (sin θ, cos θ, bias) indicating goal direction

This representation provides the agent with:
- Local threat awareness through quadrant-based sensing
- Global goal information through distance and direction measures
- Continuous state values allowing for fine-grained behavior adjustment

### 3.3 Neural Architecture
Our network architecture consists of:
```
Input Layer (8 neurons) → Hidden Layer (32 neurons) → Output Layer (4 neurons)
```

Key innovations in the architecture include:
1. Direct weight modification pathways
2. Separate adaptation rates for different network layers
3. Immediate reward integration

### 3.4 Direct Weight Modification Algorithm
The core innovation of our approach lies in the direct weight modification algorithm:

```
For each significant event (reward ≠ 0):
    1. Calculate adaptation factor α = η * reward
    2. For the action layer:
       w_action += α * h / ||h||
       where h is the hidden layer activation
    3. For the input layer:
       w_input += α * 0.1 * outer(w_action, active_inputs)
```

This algorithm provides:
- Immediate weight updates based on outcomes
- Proportional strengthening/weakening of active pathways
- Maintenance of network stability through normalization
